In project one we have to write a pseudocode and then on project two we have to write a code and make it to work. The problem Iâ€™m solving is to make a code with error and make it to work.

I began by reviewing the information that was provided to us as input. I considered every option for storing this data. Then I considered every operation I may do on my data as well as the level of temporal and spatial complexity that each data structure would provide. then I select the proper data structure based on my needs.

The project's completion is the only snag I've encountered thus far. I spent the following three days making the project bigger than it needed to be after reading the project's rubric, which was quite ambiguous.
